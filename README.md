# 🏯 claude-shogun

A multi-agent orchestration system for Claude Code, inspired by the Japanese feudal military structure.

## Overview

claude-shogun enables parallel development with multiple Claude Code agents organized in a hierarchical structure:

```
Chairman (Human)
    │
    ▼
┌─────────┐
│ SHOGUN  │ ← Supreme Commander (Project Oversight)
│ (将軍)   │
└────┬────┘
     │
     ▼
┌─────────┐
│  KARO   │ ← Field Commander (Task Management)
│ (家老)   │
└────┬────┘
     │
     ▼
┌─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┐
│1│2│3│4│5│6│7│8│ ← Infantry (Workers)
└─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┘
  ASHIGARU (足軽)
```

## Features

- **YAML-based Communication**: Reliable file-based messaging between agents
- **Human Dashboard**: Real-time overview of all projects and tasks
- **Multi-project Support**: Manage multiple projects simultaneously
- **Samurai Theme**: Fun Japanese feudal aesthetics with bilingual messages

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- WSL2 (Ubuntu recommended)
- tmux
- Claude Code CLI

### Setup (WSL)

```bash
# Clone to Windows directory (recommended for VSCode access)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-shogun.git /mnt/c/tools/claude-shogun

# Create symlink from WSL home (for easy access)
ln -s /mnt/c/tools/claude-shogun ~/claude-shogun

# Navigate and run setup
cd ~/claude-shogun
./setup.sh
```

### Deployment

```bash
# 【壱】Attach to Shogun session
tmux attach-session -t shogun

# 【弐】Start Claude Code
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions

# 【参】Give the order
# "You are the Shogun. Read instructions/shogun.md and follow the instructions."
```

## Communication Style

Agents use a samurai-themed bilingual communication style:

- `はっ！(Ha!)` - Acknowledged
- `承知つかまつった(Acknowledged!)` - Understood
- `任務完了でござる(Task completed!)` - Task completed
- `出陣いたす(Deploying!)` - Starting work
- `申し上げます(Reporting!)` - Reporting

## Roadmap

### MVP (Current)
- [x] YAML-based communication
- [x] Human dashboard
- [x] Persona system for quality assurance
- [x] Context loading rules
- [x] Auto skill generation (creates reusable skills from patterns)

### Future
- [ ] MCP integration (Notion, Slack, Google Drive, GitHub, etc.)
- [ ] Multi-project parallel execution
- [ ] Auto-recovery from agent failures
